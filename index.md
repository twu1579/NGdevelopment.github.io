This project is a python-based program that is to be used to help visualize data from imported files. And allow for antennas to be added via another imported file. The image files that we handle are mainly .obj and .stl files. We use .csv files for the importation of the additional components.

This program is available via our Git Hub repository (https://github.com/NG-Development/ngdevelopment). Just clone our project and you should be able to access our program. To make changes please have python available. If there are any bugs or problems make an issue via (https://github.com/NG-Development/ngdevelopment/issues).

For testing purposes we would like to know if there are certain file formats that you would like that we currently are unable to handle. Please extensively use each button to see if there are any bugs we have yet to find.

**Using the Program**

When the program is first executed you will be given a window with 3 buttons:

_Import Plane Model_

This opens a new window that allows you to import 3D models.

_Toggle Wireframe Mode_

This changes the view from the standard model to a wireframe model.

_Import Antennas From CSV_

This opens a window that lets you import antennas from a CSV.
